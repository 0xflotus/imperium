## Requirements

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 8.0 or greater since it uses native `async`/`await`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save imperium
```

That's all you need to do to use Imperium. You can now learn how to define your acls [here](/docs/master/defining-authorizations).
