title: What is Imperium?
---

Imperium is a role-based user's authorizations (ACL) library for Node.js.

## Concept

Almost every Node.js REST API needs to control what users can do. This library can help developers to build complex APIs in seconds. It doesn't depend on any framework and it doesn't depend on any database.

Whether or not you use a framework or a db, it is built to work with every Node.js application.
